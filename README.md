## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Now I have become more familiar with Figma I am finding my CSS much easier to build when it comes to margins and padding. I also used flexbox instead of tables for the final section as this seemed more readable in the HTML and CSS.

### Continued development

I will continue with Frontend Mentor challenges, they are a great way to reinforce my learning.
